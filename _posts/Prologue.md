I will try to keep this simple. This is something that I have wanted to do for a long time and as the new year approached, I made the conscious decision to go through with it.

This post serves to address the following:

- Why a technical blog
- Content to expect

## Why a technical blog ?

- To keep track of tools and technologies I learn
- To get better at conveying technical information in a manner that is easy to understand
- To document my experience with network labs not excluding challenges faced and resolutions adopted
- To document and keep track of technical experience outside networking as a form of side quests in a bid to stay in the loop with other technologies I'm curious about especially those that complement my niche.
- This site will complement my YouTube channel where I'll occasionally post tutorials and demonstrations using these tools.

## Content to Expect

For context, I have a background In Electrical electronics with a specialization in telecommunications(BEng, Msc). So a lot of what I'll put here will be technical information heavily centered on Network Engineering.

In addition Iâ€™ll occasionally post content on programming as it relates to network automation, Cloud infrastructure, DevOps and BackEnd development. The industry has changed rapidly over last couple of years. Therefore, it is necessary to get aquatinted with these technologies as they come.

I hope that this will signal the beginning of something great for my personal development. It is also my desire that anyone reading content from this site gains something valuable from it. So please do not hesitate to reach out with questions and, or suggestions.

To the first of many to come.

Udo diri unu.
