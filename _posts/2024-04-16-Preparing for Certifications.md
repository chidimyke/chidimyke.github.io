If you are studying for IT certifications like the CCNA you will quickly find out how overwhelming it can be. I learned better by using a hands-on approach. This way I got to see these concepts play out before my own eyes, thereby retaining more as the topics got more complicated. I will highlight the tools and approaches I took to gain practical experience during my studies.

## Setup

To begin with, all the software I used and still use was installed locally. I have an Acer Nitro 5 Laptop which came with 8 GB RAM when I purchased it back in 2018. Although I have since upgraded it to 32 GB RAM, the tools used for the CCNA studies do not require significant computing power.

### Packet Tracer

This is a free software made by CISCO which you can get by signing up with the network Academy. It has really improved over the years and I can say that it has everything you need for your CCNA studies. You can build topologies from scratch and you can easily share these topologies as well with anyone.

### Pearson CCNA Simulator

I discovered this one much later in my ccna studies and I was impressed. It comes with preset network topologies that let you practice all the topics that require you to â€˜â€™Configure and verifyâ€™â€™. I find this to be important as it lets you focus on what CISCO expects you to know with respect to device and service configuration.

However, unlike packet tracer, it does not let you build topologies from scratch. Regardless I would still recommend this for anyone, particularly begineers who have a hard time coming up with their one topology ideas.

## Theory and Practice Exams

Once you have your environment setup, the next decision will be how to go about consuming the theory, taking notes and knowledge checks. I use a combination of resources which I will highlight from vital to least used.

### Jeremyâ€™s IT Lab

By far the most important of them all. This course by Jeremy MCdowan(check for correct spelling) was the best and the most important. I got this course on Udemy and I still refer to it sometimes due to its clarity and the straightforward nature of the tutor. It comes with Anki flashcards and Packet tracer labs to go along with each topic you learn. I would HIGHLY recommend it.

### OCG and Pearson Test Prep

The official cert guide is next on my list. Authored by Wendell Odom it addresses all the topics in required detail. I purchased the premium version so I could get access to the test prep and secondary resources like flashcards, memory aids, and supplementary videos.

### Note-taking

Highly subjective. I used a combination of plain old pen and paper to notepad. There were recommendations like Notion and obsidian, but I like to keep things simple. Perhaps if you have a tablet or an iPad you can make use of apps like notes, good notes, or noteful. these are great.

For me, I found it easier to listen and keep notetaking at a minimum while the lectures went on, knowing fully well I would return to them later after some practice labs. So it is more of a back-and-forth process.

### Microsoft CO-pilot

Yes AI is here and I took full advantage of it. On Windows 11 I had copilot opened as a sidebar while I studied which made learning so much easier. When I did not feel satisfied with an explanation or needed some clarification with a concept I simply had co-pilot come to the rescue. It saved me lots of time.

### CCNA Exam Review

As I got more comfortable I needed to have an idea of what to expect on the exam day. The exam review by Cisco gives you a simulated testing experience without the need to install anything. Compared to BOSON this one is lightweight.

### BOSON Ex Sim Max for CCNA

Very much talked about in the Cisco certification space but slightly more expensive than the CCNA exam review. I really liked this one although I used it the least, it did a great job of exposing gaps in my understanding of the basics. The labs that come with the test will seem overwhelming if you have not done enough practice on your own and rightfully so. I must admit however that some of the questions here are a bit beyond the scope of the CCNA.

### Habits and Final Thoughts

I think the most important tool to pass any certification or carry out anything in life is your mindset and with a good mindset comes better habits. I had to change my routine during this time and I must say it did change my life. One of those habits was my study routine I had to create a schedule and stick to it

I would recommend dedicating at least 30 minutes to 2 hours daily for studies. Try to make learning your first act of the day as your state of mind happens to be at its best when you wake up. Always prioritize rest, I canâ€™t stress this enough. Do not be afraid and good luck with your studies.

Udo diri Unu.
